Welcome to the 1920s! Unprecedented economic growth from World War 1 and new technological innovations have culminated in a bustling era of optimism and fulfillment. Under our Republican government, U.S business booms and stock market prices continue to rise each day. With this newfound prosperity, common American citizens can now allocate more money to purchase luxury commodities like the now-affordable automobile and new fangled radios. We are in the midst of an American cultural revolution, out with the old America and in with the new!

And in this cultural revolution is social rebellion. Scandalous young women have adopted the "Flapper" style, cutting their hair short and wearing dresses hemmed at the knee. But one relic of WW1 still plagues the people. The 18th Amendment from 1919 strictly prohibits the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages. Prohibition is a polarizing and controversial reform movement. Strife within political parties over the issue is common, and is reflected in the urban-rural divide. World War 1 facilitated the rise of prohibition, but as its relevance faded so did support. But who even follows the law these days? So, are you up to the bootlegging challenge?
