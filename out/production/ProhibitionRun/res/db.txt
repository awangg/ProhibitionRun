American Temperance Society Forms (1826): The American Temperance Society was the first U.S. social movement organization to support a specific reform cause. They sought to become the clearinghouse on all temperance-related information. Riding the reform wave that ultimately abolished slavery, they were the precursor the post-Civil War Prohibition movement.
Prohibition Party Forms (1869): With abolition falling out of the spotlight, Prohibition joined the wave of reform movements that sought to take its place. Founded in 1869 as one of only parties where women could participate, the Prohibition Party along with the Women's Christian Temperance Union fought for the restriction of alcohol. With the arrival of the Progressive Era along with pressure from World War 1, their heyday came in 1919 with the ratification of the 18th Amendment.
Women's Christian Temperance Union Forms (1874): Founded on the basis of "the entire prohibition of the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors as a beverage." In conjunction with their suffragist activities, they constituted a large proportion of the grassroots core of the temperance movement.
Wilson Act (1890): Also known as the Original Packages Act, the legislation allowed 'dry' states (those that had restricted or banned alcohol) to prevent/regulate alcohol arriving from 'wet' states. Alcohol arriving in a state would be subject to that state's laws. The act failed to provide a mechanism for federal enforcement. Regarded as 'toothless'
Anti-Saloon League Forms (1893): Originally founded as a state prohibition organization, by 1895 the Anti-Saloon league was the preeminent national prohibition advocacy group. Allied with groups such as the Women's Christian Temperance Union, the Anti-Saloon League was instrumental in the passage of the 18th Amendment.
Webb-Kenyon Act (1913): The Webb-Kenyon Act made it a violation of federal law to ship an intoxicating beverage across state lines in violation of the laws of the destination state. Although intended to strengthen the 1890 Wilson Act, the lack of federal enforcement rendered the regulation toothless as its predecessor.
Wartime Prohibition Act (1918): As German-American voices were sidelined during World War 1, so disappeared their strong anti-prohibition voice. The result was an energized prohibition movement with a new argument: national security. The immediate result was the Wartime Prohibition Act which restricted banned the sale of beverages with more than 1.28% alcohol by volume. This was intended to boost production by preventing intoxication as well as save grain.
18th Amendment (1919): The 18th Amendment was a nationwide ban on the manufacture, sale, or transportation of liquor. It represented the culmination of decades of temperance efforts on the part of a slew of organizations.
Association Against the Prohibition Amendment Forms (1918): Founded in 1918, the Association Against the Prohibition Amendment was the leading anti-prohibition organization. When the problems caused by prohibition became increasingly evident, the organization was there to mobilize opposition to prohibition. With support growing, it ran a publicity campaign in 1928 that eventually lead to the 21st Amendment and the repeal of prohibition.
National Prohibition Act (1919): The National Prohibition Act, popularly known as the Volstead Act was Congress' law interpreting/enforcing the 18th Amendment. Like the 18th Amendment, it did not explicitly ban the consumption of alcohol, which was an interesting loopwhole. President Woodrow Wilson attempted to veto the bill on the grounds that it also covered wartime prohibition, but was overridden by the House and Senate.
Cullen-Harrison Act (1933): Legalized alcoholic beverages with 3.2% alcohol by volume; replacement of the Volstead act the end of prohibition. Essentially the legislative affirmation to the 21st Amendment and the end of prohibition. (This came after the 21st amendment)
21st Amendment (1933): As the downsides of prohibition made it increasingly unpopular, support grew for its repeal. With the shadow of war that facilitated the 18th Amendment gone and the Great Depression in its place, the 21st Amendment brought an end to the Prohibition Era. Crime had run amok and the Volstead Act had proved impossible to enforce in the face of corruption and lack of staffing. Resentment to this situation culminated in the 21st Amendment.
