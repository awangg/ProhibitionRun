Wilson Act (1890): Also known as the Original Packages Act, the legislation allowed 'dry' states (those that had restricted or banned alcohol) to prevent/regulate alcohol arriving from 'wet' states. Alcohol arriving in a state would be subject to that state's laws. The act failed to provide a mechanism for federal enforcement. Regarded as 'toothless'
Webb-Kenyon Act (1913): The Webb-Kenyon Act made it a violation of federal law to ship an intoxicating beverage across state lines in violation of the laws of the destination state. Although intended to strengthen the 1890 Wilson Act, the lack of federal enforcement rendered the regulation toothless as its predecessor.
Wartime Prohibition Act (1918): As German-American voices were sidelined during World War 1, so disappeared their strong anti-prohibition voice. The result was an energized prohibition movement with a new argument: national security. The immediate result was the Wartime Prohibition Act which restricted banned the sale of beverages with more than 1.28% alcohol by volume. This was intended to boost production by preventing intoxication as well as save grain.
18th Amendment (1919): The 18th Amendment was a nationwide ban on the manufacture, sale, or transportation of liquor. It represented the culmination of decades of temperance efforts on the part of a slew of organizations.
Volstead Act (1919): The Volstead Act was Congress' law interpreting/enforcing the 18th Amendment.
